# Introduction

**xlkit** is a declarative Excel generation library for TypeScript.

## Why xlkit?

Existing JS/TypeScript Excel libraries (like ExcelJS) are **imperative**, making it difficult to see the final output from the code.

xlkit provides a **declarative** API, where the code clearly shows the final Excel structure.

## Comparison with ExcelJS

| Aspect | ExcelJS (Imperative) | xlkit (Declarative) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Style | Cell-by-cell manipulation | Declare final structure |
| Clarity | Hard to see result from code | Code shows result clearly |
| Like | jQuery | React |

## Key Features

- **Declarative API**: Easy to understand final output
- **Method chaining**: Fluent Excel construction
- **Full TypeScript support**: Type-safe with IntelliSense
- **Preset styles**: Apply common styles easily
- **Node.js + Browser**: Works in both environments
